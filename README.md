# «☼Masterwork Dwarf Fortress - Studded with Patches☼»

This is a community driven branch of Meph's excellent
*Masterwork Dwarf Fortress*.

## Playing

If all you want to do is play, you can download one of two
ready-to-go zip files:

* The [master release](https://github.com/pjf/masterwork-dwarf-fortress/archive/master.zip) contains all bugfixes and improvements which are considered stable. It is always based upon the most recently release of Masterwork Dwarf Fortress.

* The [unified release](https://github.com/pjf/masterwork-dwarf-fortress/archive/unified.zip) is the same as the master release, but also includes *experimental features and bugfixes*. Things don't get placed into unified until we're pretty sure they work, so it's recommended for most users, but occasionally things will still be a bit rough around the edges.

If you already have the latest release of Dwarf Fortress, you can
download patch files *should* update your distributions to the
Studded With Patches versions of the files. These are automatically
generated, and are not guaranteed to work. If in doubt, use the
zips above:

* [master release (patches only)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9702672/MWDF/MWDF-patch-master.zip)
* [unified release (patches only)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9702672/MWDF/MWDF-patch-unified.zip)

## Reporting bugs

Please report bugs in the
[issues tracker](https://github.com/pjf/masterwork-dwarf-fortress/issues).
Please try to be as specific as possible.

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute, and you're already familiar with git,
then start by
[forking this repo](https://github.com/pjf/masterwork-dwarf-fortress/fork).

Usually you'll want to do your own work on the master branch, as
it's considered "stable". Note that the unified branch *only* consists
of merges of the other branches, and it may occasionally be subject
to rebasing. Working from it is not recommended, but you can
do so if you've got a good reason.

One you're happy with your work, send through a pull request to
mark it as a candidate for merging.

If you're not already familiar with git, then there are
[some great guides online](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git).
