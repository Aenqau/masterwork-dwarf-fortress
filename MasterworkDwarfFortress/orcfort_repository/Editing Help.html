<h1>Editing Help</h1>
<p>The Orc Fortress Manual is written using Markdown, the same language
that's used for reddit posts, github commits, and in numerous other
places on the Internet. It's a very intuitive syntax, so don't be afraid
to just start editing a page and pick it up as you go.</p>

<p>The wiki uses <a href="https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki">Gollum</a>, a lightweight
wiki engine that runs on top of git.</p>

<p>As a guide, the following links may prove useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="Markdown Syntax">http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax</a></li>
<li><a href="Gollum Documentation">https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Please <strong>be bold</strong> with your edits, and don't be afraid to make changes.</p>
