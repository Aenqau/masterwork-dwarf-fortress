        <p align="center"><em>Orc Fortress is a plug in which builds on the foundation of Meph's Masterwork Dwarf Fortress and of course on Bay12 Games' Dwarf Fortress itself.  It also uses a few item assets, building designs, and concepts which originated in other great mods including Genesis, Kobold Camp, Legends of Forlorn Realms, and !!Science!!.  Thanks to all who share their work on the forums and in particular to Hugo_the_dwarf, Deon, Phoebus, Narhiril, Urist da Vinci, i2amroy, Putnam, Wrex, 
        gwathlobal; whoever made the Orc sprites; and the general combined experience and wisdom of the Bay12 forums.  Any components of Orc Fortress that are my original work I am certainly happy if they are freely reused and recycled, in fact that is one of my main motivations for posting it.
        </em></p>
        <p align="center"><em>The Orc in the Logo is by by Eva Zimmermann.</em></p>
        <p align="center">Special thanks to the DFHack team and scripters who 
        make all the cool plugins, such as expwnent (autosyndrome), Falconne 
        (fortress utility plugins), and Putnam (itemsyndrome).&nbsp; It is these 
        scripts that make advanced weapons and magic system possible!</p></td>
        <p align="center">Particular thanks to Wrex for detailed testing and development of orcish 
        weapons.</p>
        <p align="center">Particular thanks to gwathlobal for detailed testing 
        of armor and materials.</p>
        <p align="center">Particular thanks (again) to Putnam for allowing us to use his 
        language file transcription of Mordor-speech.</p>
        <p align="center"><em>Special thanks to Meph for invaluable help and advice on many occassions.&nbsp;  And also, thanks to all the rest of the Masterwork community for your feedback, patience, modding tips and solutions, and for generally being awesome.
        <p align="center"><em>Extra special thanks to Tarn Adams and Bay 12 Games, for developing this unique, wonderful, and slightly insane world and making it so moddable!  Please consider supporting ongoing development at http://bay12games.com/support.html.
