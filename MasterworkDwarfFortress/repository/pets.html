        <ul>
          <li>All creatures can be milked twice as often as in vanilla.        </li>
          <li>All poisonous/venomous creatures can be milked for their poison/venom.</li>
          <li>Many creatures give fleece when sheared,  giving 3 units of cloth after spinning.</li>
          <li>Many creatures give pelts when butchered, giving furs after tanning.</li>
          <li>All animals give leather relative of their size. A cat gives 1, a oxen gives 7.</li>
          <li>All animals lay way, way less eggs.</li>
          <li>Grazing animals can be kept indoors and fed, using the Stables.</li>
          <li>Many animals can learn skills (biting, dodging, fighter) in the Warbeast Kennels.</li>
          <li>Many animals can be armored in Iron or Steel in the Warbeast Kennels.</li>
          <li>Changelings are a base-creature for transformations, always have some around.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All in all animal farming makes a lot more sense if is far more powerful than in vanilla DF, but the amount of eggs has been nerfed a lot. You can create many more items and very powerful war-beasts, but less food this way.</p>
<p>This is a list of all domestic pets you can buy at embark. Prices are the embark points needed, the caravan prices depend on demand and broker skill. Your civilization might have access to additional pets, which are dependant on the biome it lives in. </p>
<p>Kobolds and Orcs have their own special pets, more info about these can be found in their respective manuals.</p>

        This ward has the power to unveil the cultmaster of the carp god. Be sure that you want to do this before you use it. A nuisance while hidden, he is rather docile.
